## ABOUT

Product Analyst with **6 years** experience in commercial data analysis and ensuring accurate insights. Working in teams ranging from 2 to 17 members, both remotely and on-site.

In addition to core analytics knowledge, I've implemented multiple features related to ETL, data checking and machine learning.
